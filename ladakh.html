<p class="p2">Another dumpling soup made in the same way as the Chutagi but shaped like really tiny thumb sized chapatis.
The soup is delicious with the essence of all the different vegetables that are put into it.
For a nonvegeterian skew mutton is most preferred and potatoes are a must to give it a nice flavour.
The flour of Barley is roasted and kneaded in a little oil and eaten with some sugar.
Another way to eat it is with Tangthur and Zathuk which is butter milk.
Paba is mixed with Tangthur and other vegetables and eaten. A very healthy source of food.
Gur Gur is the name of the instrument in which the tea is made. After churning the curd/ yogurt the butter that is left is used to make this tea.
It is not sweet but delicious in the cold weather. The ingredients used to make this tea are butter, milk and tea powder, all of this is then put into the shaker.
In English it is called Butter Tea and in Tibetan it is called Tsaza.
Thukpa which is just noodle soup is also a Tibetan dish that is made is Ladakh.
The flour is kneaded, the broth is cooked containing onion, tomato, garlic and other vegetables if veg and beef/ mutton if non-veg
once it looks a little cooked the flour is rolled into thin strings and dropped into the boiling broth.</p>
<h1 class="head1">FAMOUS PLACES</h1>
<h3 class="head3">1.NUBRA VALLEY</h3>
<img src=G:/webdev/images/ladakh_11.jpg class="imag">
<p class="p2">Nubra Valley is replete with unexplored and lesser explored nature’s gem.
The valley is undoubtedly for the adventurous souls who would like to push their endurance 
limit for sighting some extraordinary places. The main sightseeing places and tourist attractions in Nubra Valley includes,
Diskit Monastery, which is the largest and oldest Buddhist monastery in the valley; the tall statue of Maitreyi Buddha,
and the desert of Hunder. Apart from this, Nubra has stunning hot springs in Panamik.
Other two worth seeing places in Nubra Valley are Sumur and Turtuk.</p>
<h3 class="head3">2.PANGONG LAKE</h3>
<img src=G:/webdev/images/ladakh_10.jpg class="imag">
<p class="p2">Pangong Lake is Ladakh’s most important tourist attraction.
This azure stretch of endorheic lake is situated at a dizzying height of 4350 meter and 
looks as if it is piece of heaven that fell on earth. Surrounded by barren mountains, this lake is 
probably one of the most beautiful lakes in Ladakh. Pangong is a transboundary lake that is expanded
between India and China for almost 134 kms.</p>
<h3 class="head3">3.Phuktal Monastery</h3>
<img src=G:/webdev/images/ladakh_12.jpg class="imag">
<p class="p2>A trip to the famous Phuktal monastery will give you a surreal experience, giving an image
as if it is stuck in the mountains. More or less, it appears to look like legos attached on the walls.
The Phuktal monastery is located at the remote Lungnak Valley, south of Zanskar. And the uniqueness of this
monastery is that the structure is built on the cliff. From here, the view is breathtaking;
it gives a panoramic view of the adjoining mountains and lustrous greens and Lungnak River.</p>
